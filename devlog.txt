April 19 2015 - Giffen
	made backbuffer clear hellish fuschia per tradition
	switched gizmos to 2d so scaling doesn't dissappear them
	ortho camera's "size" param is HALF the height of the frustum, in unity units.
	note - Unity appears to follow LEFT HANDedness.  xy as expected, z+ into screen.
	aimed camera at [128,120], and set it up for 1:1 pixel display in a 256x240 display
	shitty 256x240 background added, sprite set to 1:1 pixel units, origin bottom left.
	shitty 4 frame animating sprite added
